::: Increase File Size → 

→ Go to php.ini
→ Search for the 'post_max_siz'e entry, and enter a larger number than the size of your database 
    → post_max_size = 25M
→ Edit the entry for 'memory_limit' and give it a larger value than the one given to 'post_max_size'
→ Then ensure the value of 'upload_max_filesize' is smaller than 'post_max_size'.
→ The order from biggest to smallest should be:
    → memory_limit
    → post_max_size
    → upload_max_filesize
→ Restart Apache Services.


::: Example :
    max_execution_time = 5000
    max_input_time = 5000
    memory_limit = 1000M
    post_max_size = 750M
    upload_max_filesize = 750M
    
    
    
    

::: Increase Query Execution Time :

→ (For Windows) Go to xampp\phpmyadmin\config.inc.php 
→ Change $cfg['ExecTimeLimit'] = 6000;

→ Go to xampp\php\php.ini
→ Change max_execution_time = 5000

→ Go to xampp\mysql\bin\my.ini
→ max_allowed_packet = 200M
